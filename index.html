            <h2>SpendHQ</h2>
            <p>
              SpendHQ is an AI-powered spend intelligence platform designed to help Fortune 500 companies including
              Pepsi and
              Under Armour optimize their spending by integrating supplier and third-party data.
              Before my involvement, the platform suffered from a dated and inconsistent user experience that frustrated
              users and limited engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led a complete UX/UI transformation, implementing
              scalable
              systems, redesigning workflows, and delivering a user-focused, modern interface.

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>SpendHQ faced several challenges when I joined the team. The platform's design was outdated and
                fragmented, leading to cognitive overload and inefficiencies for users. The organization lacked user
                feedback documentation, analytics tools, and research artifacts, making it difficult to identify and
                address user pain points effectively. </p>
              <p>The user base was diverse, ranging from financial analysts to C-suite executives, each requiring
                tailored
                solutions to meet their unique needs. Additionally, the absence of established design systems or
                workflows
                created inefficiencies in collaboration and development.</p>

              <img src="assets/images/cases/shq/compliance.png" alt="Diversity Screen" /><span>Compliance Mock-up</span>

              <h3>My Approach</h3>
              <p>To address these challenges, I established a data-driven foundation by implementing tools like Pendo
                and Hotjar to track user behavior, including NPS scores, retention rates, and heatmaps. These analytics
                were complemented by competitive research, user interviews, and testing, providing a comprehensive
                understanding of user needs. I collaborated with the head of product to develop four key user personas,
                representing users from technical analysts to executives, and mapped detailed user flows using FigJam to
                align workflows with business objectives.</p>
              <p>
                Building a scalable design system was a critical component of the redesign. I created a comprehensive
                Figma ecosystem, incorporating atomic design principles to develop reusable components and centralized
                design files. This system supported both the current app and the redesigned interface, streamlining
                collaboration and iteration. To foster collaboration across teams, I facilitated workshops with
                stakeholders, product owners, and developers, aligning priorities and accelerating the iterative design
                process.

              <h3>Solutions</h3>
              <p>One of the most impactful solutions was the redesign of the "Power Filter," a global filtering tool
                used
                to refine data across all screens. I transformed this feature into an accessible, modular header
                component, replacing the overly complex and disjointed workflow. This redesign was validated through
                hi-fi
                prototypes and user testing, resulting in significantly faster task completion rates and higher
                satisfaction.</p>
              <p>I also delivered a cohesive reskin and UX optimization, standardizing UI components across over 100
                screens to reduce cognitive overload and ensure consistency. To address user confusion, I designed and
                integrated a comprehensive help system, including contextual pop-overs and dedicated documentation
                sections, which improved onboarding and reduced support inquiries. Additionally, I developed interactive
                prototypes to gather actionable feedback and avoid unnecessary development time, saving hundreds of
                hours
                across the project.</p>

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <p>Leading SpendHQ’s transformation involved establishing scalable design processes, leveraging
                data-driven
                insights, and fostering cross-functional collaboration. By prioritizing user needs and aligning them
                with
                business goals, I delivered a modern, intuitive platform that significantly improved engagement,
                satisfaction, and scalability. The project not only enhanced the experience for SpendHQ’s users but also
                set a strong foundation for ongoing development and innovation.</p>

            <h2>NASCAR</h2>
            <p>NASCAR, the premier stock-car racing sanctioning body in North America, oversees some of the most iconic
              racing events in the world. As part of a restructuring effort, NASCAR transitioned from third-party
              development teams to internal teams for creating and maintaining their digital properties. </p>
            <p>My role was to bring expertise in WordPress development and UX/UI design to bridge the gap between
              designers and developers. I collaborated closely with internal teams to build new websites, enhance
              existing
              ones, and ensure seamless functionality during live events, all while adhering to NASCAR’s

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>NASCAR’s transition to internal teams created several hurdles. repurposed developers new to PHP and
                WordPress were tasked with
                building custom WordPress sites, while graphic designers with limited UX/UI experience were responsible
                for creating digital experiences.</p>
              <p>This mismatch in expertise led to challenges in execution and collaboration. Additionally, the
                organization required high-performing digital platforms to support real-time race updates, which
                demanded
                seamless integration between design and development. NASCAR’s custom WordPress framework added further
                complexity, requiring precise modifications to themes and plugins to meet both user and business needs.
              </p>

              <img src="assets/images/cases/nascar/sebring.png" alt="Sebring Homepage" /><span>Sebring website</span>

              <h3>My Approach</h3>
              <p>To address these challenges, I began by participating in creative briefings with product managers and
                graphic designers to review research findings and project goals. These sessions informed design
                decisions
                and ensured that all modifications adhered to industry-standard UX/UI principles, accessibility
                guidelines, and the execution constraints of NASCAR’s custom WordPress framework. By analyzing site
                designs, I provided actionable feedback on development feasibility, aligning design intent with
                technical
                realities.</p>
              <p>During development, I worked independently on projects such as the NASCAR Mexico, ARCA Menards, and
                Sebring Raceway websites. Each site required custom modifications to NASCAR’s WordPress themes and
                plugins, which I implemented while maintaining scalability and usability. To ensure efficient progress
                tracking, I used Atlassian Jira to document updates, manage tasks, and address QA feedback.</p>
              <p>In addition to building new websites, I provided enhancements to existing platforms, such as NASCAR.com
                and IMSA.com, improving user experience and addressing technical issues. I was also responsible for live
                monitoring and issue resolution during high-traffic race weekends. Working from NASCAR headquarters in
                Charlotte, NC, I collaborated with live ops teams to resolve real-time issues, such as lap-time
                reporting
                errors, ensuring uninterrupted service during critical events.</p>

                Drivers web page</span>

              <h3>Solutions</h3>
              <p>One of my primary contributions was delivering three major new websites: NASCAR Mexico, ARCA Menards,
                and
                Sebring Raceway. These platforms were built from the ground up, incorporating responsive designs, modern
                UX/UI principles, and accessibility standards. I also enhanced NASCAR.com and IMSA.com, making UX/UI
                improvements and resolving technical challenges to ensure optimal performance.</p>
              <p>Another key solution was bridging the gap between designers and developers. By providing UX/UI guidance
                and ensuring compatibility with the custom WordPress framework, I streamlined the collaboration process,
                enabling efficient execution of projects. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in NASCAR’s live digital
                operations, quickly addressing technical issues during live races, such as resolving errors in real-time
                lap-time reporting.</p>

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <p>My work with NASCAR involved balancing technical expertise with cross-functional collaboration to
                deliver
                high-quality digital experiences. By bridging the gap between design and development, I ensured that all
                projects met NASCAR’s high standards for performance, usability, and accessibility.</p>
              <p>The successful launch
                of three major websites and enhancements to existing platforms demonstrated my ability to adapt to
                complex
                technical frameworks and high-pressure environments. Ultimately, my contributions supported NASCAR’s
                mission to provide engaging digital experiences for fans and stakeholders alike.</p>

            <h2>AMSI</h2>
            <p>Automotive Management Services Inc. (AMSI) manages all digital advertising for its car dealership
              clients,
              spanning major brands from Aston Martin to Volvo. The company faced significant challenges in managing and
              creating website add-ons, display ads, and email campaigns due to the lack of a project management system
              and frequent issues with compliance, accessibility, and coding errors.</p>
            <p>My role was to address these inefficiencies by designing and developing a system that would standardize
              and
              automate processes, ensuring consistent quality and compliance while improving task efficiency.</p>

              <p>AMSI's workflow was a bit chaotic, with no project management system in place to streamline operations.
                Digital assets, including webpages, email campaigns, and ads, often suffered from errors in coding,
                accessibility, and responsiveness, leading to potential penalties for OEM compliance violations.</p>
              <p>Additionally, long development times and a lack of integration between teams created bottlenecks,
                impacting the delivery and quality of assets. AMSI needed a centralized system to manage projects, track
                performance, and ensure compliance across all deliverables.</p>

              <h3>My Approach</h3>
              <p>To tackle these challenges, I began by conducting extensive research into the functions of every role
                within the agency. This allowed me to identify pain points and gaps in the workflow. Based on these
                findings, I conceptualized and designed "Phalanx," a comprehensive system to build, track, and optimize
                digital assets. Phalanx featured drag-and-drop functionality, real-time analytics integration, and
                error-free, OEM-compliant code generation, addressing AMSI's core inefficiencies.</p>
              <p>Collaboration with account executives and OEM compliance teams was critical to understanding the
                specific
                requirements and goals of each campaign. For custom projects, I either built assets from scratch or
                utilized high-performing templates as a foundation. Leveraging data from tools like Google Analytics,
                Visual Web Optimizer, and Campaigner, I analyzed the performance of assets, identified areas for
                improvement, and iterated on designs to enhance effectiveness.</p>
              <p>One of the most impactful projects was redesigning vehicle search modules for client homepages. By
                analyzing heat mapping and interaction metrics, we identified two distinct user groups: those with a
                specific make and model in mind and those with only a general idea. Through A/B testing, we implemented
                and optimized three variants of the module: dropdowns for year, make, and model; clickable images for
                body
                types; and a combination of both. This iterative approach ensured the module catered to diverse user
                preferences while improving engagement and usability.</p>

              <p>Phalanx became the centerpiece of AMSI’s transformation. Designed as a custom WordPress theme with
                custom
                plugins, it automated the generation of digital assets such as websites, email campaigns, ads, and
                landing
                pages. The system included a UI component library built with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and PHP,
                enabling users to create OEM-compliant, responsive assets quickly and efficiently. Phalanx was
                responsible
                for at least 90% of the digital assets produced, with highly custom projects handled manually.</p>

              <p>The system also incorporated job management, staff performance reporting, budget tracking, and client
                relationship management features, addressing broader operational gaps. User testing with SEO, email, ad,
                and account management teams ensured that Phalanx aligned with their daily workflows and goals. I
                conducted usability tests to identify pain points and refine user paths, resulting in a seamless
                experience for internal teams.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I implemented rigorous testing protocols using tools like Litmus and cross-browser
                testing
                to eliminate errors in responsiveness and accessibility. Optimized templates were informed by
                performance
                data from analytics tools, ensuring assets were both effective and compliant. These changes not only
                reduced errors but also saved clients from potential penalties related to OEM compliance violations.</p>

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <p>My work at AMSI demonstrated the power of combining user-centered design with technical innovation to
                solve complex organizational challenges. By developing Phalanx, I addressed inefficiencies, ensured
                compliance, and enhanced task efficiency by 400%. The system transformed AMSI’s digital operations,
                enabling the team to consistently deliver high-quality, data-driven assets. This case study highlights
                my
                ability to identify organizational pain points, design scalable solutions, and lead cross-functional
                collaboration to drive measurable results.</p>

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>Learning and applying the science of well-being is often a time-consuming and confusing process. Users
                must absorb complex subject matter and track multiple goals, which can feel overwhelming and
                discouraging.
                Existing solutions lacked engaging methods to teach well-being science while motivating users to take
                actionable steps.</p>

              <h3>My Approach</h3>
              <p>
                To address these challenges, we conducted a comprehensive SWOT analysis of 25 competing apps in the
                health
                and wellness space. This analysis highlighted gaps in gamification and the repetitive interactions that
                users found disengaging.</p>
              <p>To better understand our audience, we conducted phone interviews, collecting both
                quantitative and qualitative data, such as current app usage, likes and dislikes, and interest in our
                mission. Using these insights, we created user personas representing adults aged 19–40 at various stages
                of their well-being journeys.
              </p>

                    class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></p>

              <p>
                We also conducted card sorting and ideation sessions to determine the app’s core features and user
                flows.

              <p>
                Mood-boarding exercises established the app's visual tone, while whiteboarding sessions helped us design
                workflows and wireframes that catered to all personas. These efforts guided branding decisions, ensuring
                Wick would feel like a supportive companion on the well-being journey, incorporating nature-inspired
                aesthetics and a comforting fire motif into its logo and design system.

              <h3>Solutions</h3>
              <p>
                Our design process started with wireframes based on whiteboard designs, followed by the development of a
                lo-fi prototype to test the app's core features.
              </p>

              <img src="assets/images/cases/wick/lo-fi.png" alt="Lo-fi Screenshot">
              <span>Lo-fi Screenshot</span>

              <p>
                User feedback revealed valuable insights, including pain
                points and opportunities for improvement, which were addressed in the hi-fi prototype. The hi-fi design
                incorporated all user states identified during testing and brought the app’s visual language to life.
                The
                app’s journey-based format, combined with gamified tasks, resonated strongly with users during testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wick's gamified structure rewarded users for completing tasks, with rewards weighted based on task
                difficulty to encourage progression. Points, badges, and other elements fostered a sense of achievement
                while breaking down complex well-being science into manageable steps. The app’s empathetic tone and
                adventure-inspired visual language created a welcoming and motivating user experience.

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <p>Wick successfully transformed the complex science of well-being into a digestible, gamified experience
                that users loved. By combining user-centric design with gamification and empathetic communication, the
                app
                stands out in the crowded wellness space. With a 100% approval rating, Wick proved to be an engaging,
